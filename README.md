üè• HealthAI Suite ‚Äî Intelligent Analytics for Patient Care
üöÄ Project Overview



HealthAI Suite is an end-to-end AI/ML system designed to analyze patient health data ‚Äî including electronic health records (EHR), medical images, clinical text, and patient feedback ‚Äî to improve clinical decision support, patient engagement, and hospital operations.

This system combines Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for:

Disease risk classification

Hospital stay prediction

Patient subgroup discovery

Medical association mining

Radiology image analysis

Sentiment analysis

Multilingual translation
